*The client for this project can be found [here][client].*

This project uses deep learning to help a robot find a way through the maze without the help of any pathfinding algorithms!
You can see this project in action [on this video][demo]!

The server uses deep learning to find a way through a maze and controls a robot via Wi-Fi using an MQTT protocol.
